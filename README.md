Context-driven documentation for the CMS, driven by markdown!

## Formatting

Prepend your markdown files like so:

```md
[ClassName]: / (Page)
[Title]: / (This is the Demo Page)
[Description]: / (This is a Demo page that you can see a demo on)
```

To populate those fields on the object

## License
See [License](license.md)

We have included a 3-clause BSD license you can use as a default. We advocate for the BSD license as
it is one of the most permissive and open licenses.

Feel free to alter the [license.md](license.md) to suit if you wan to use an alternative license.

## Documentation
 * [Documentation readme](docs/en/readme.md)

Add links into your docs/<language> folder here unless your module only requires minimal documentation
in that case, add here and remove the docs folder. You might use this as a quick table of content if you
mhave multiple documentation pages.
