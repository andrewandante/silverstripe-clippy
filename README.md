# Clippy

Context-driven documentation for the CMS, driven by markdown!

## Formatting

Put your markdown files in a directory called `docs/userguides` or whatever you configure via:

```yml
SilverStripe\Clippy\Controllers\DocumentationPageController:
    docs_dir: /docs/userguides
```

You should include a `_index.md` file that will serve as the Navigation - the simplest
version is just a list of links, e.g.

```md
# Index

* [Intro](introduction.md)
* [First Page](Page.md)
* [Second Page](SecondPage.md)
  * [Third Page](depth/ThirdPage.md)
```

The module also looks for `introduction.md` in the root level of the docs dir - this will be
the "home" page to land on if no other page is requested.

Prepend your markdown files with metadata like so:

```md
[ClassName]: / (Page)
[Title]: / (This is the Demo Page)
[Description]: / (This is a Demo page that you can see a demo on)
```

To populate those fields on the object generated by the dev/task.

To turn your markdown into ~~gold~~ DataObjects, run `dev/tasks/GenerateUserGuides`.
You should see some output about manipulation of images and links, that's to keep things
safe and to ensure they work inside the CMS environment.

To that end, all links and image definitions should be relative, i.e.

```md
![This is the alt text for an image](screenshots/image.jpeg)

This here [is another link to a page on the same level](sibling.md)

But [this link is for a child](directory/child.md)
```
