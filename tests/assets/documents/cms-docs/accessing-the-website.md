# Accessing the website (test version)

---

There are two environments; Production and UAT. Production is where the live website lives - any changes to this can be
seen by members of the public (unless whitelisted). UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing and this is where new
features are developed and tested before being deployed to Production.
